How to Use Mod: the interface is through chat or gui (gui use is below) there are several commands you can use such as:

#doScript (runs commands typed after it if ther'e seperated by /nl/ eg: "doScript say start/nl/wait 1/nl/say stopped" 
This has a limit of 256 charictors because of minmecrafts chat limit)

#load (loads a script into your MacroFiles folder, "load nameOfScript start/nl/wait 1/nl/say stopped")

#run (runs a script saved in MacroFiles folder, "run nameOfScript")

#stop/stop (stops the current script from running)

Scripts are run one command at a time, each command is sepperated by /nl/ to simbolize a new line, using the 
editer you can convert easy to read scripts:

say hi wait 1 jump crouch wait 0.5 stopCrouch say bye

into functional code:

say hi/nl/wait 1/nl/jump/nl/crouch/nl/wait 0.5/nl/stopCrouch/nl/say bye

if you want a list of all the commands look at the help.txt file

HOW TO USE EDITOR/GUI:
type #e or #edit to access editer it will (hopefully) open a blank page
theres 100 preset lines (hopefully you don't need more)
you can load files from the MacroFiles folder (in your .minecraft folder)
it is a bit glitchy as i coded it myself, but your welcome to create your own editor 
because it just saves the scripts into the MacroFiles folder with the format shown above
