# ForgeMacro
Formatter for my macro forge mod

This is a minecraft mod that allows you to write scripts in-game to automate stuff

The programing launguage I created has functions, if-statement etc.

Was a super fun project to work on, and also was my first GUI.


At some point I'll add some example scripts to this.
